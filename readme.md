## Start
refer to the document of [**jhipster**](https://www.jhipster.tech/development/).

- set up the dev environment by following instruction above.
- run cloudRegistry before others: `.\mvnw`(linux) or `mvnw`(cmd in windows)
- run microservice locally with active profile: spring.profiles.active=dev,no-liquibase

`TIPS: another way is to run in docker compose.`
